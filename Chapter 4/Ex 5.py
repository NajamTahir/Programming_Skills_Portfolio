1.There's a list called favorite_fruits that contains the person's favorite fruits, including 'apples', 'bananas', and 'strawberries'.

2.The code uses a series of if statements to check if certain fruits are in the favorite_fruits list.

3.For each fruit being checked, if it is found in the list, the program prints a message indicating that the person really likes that fruit.

4.Specifically:

 If 'bananas' are in the favorite_fruits list, it prints: "You really like bananas!"
 If 'apples' are in the favorite_fruits list, it prints: "You really like apples!"
 If 'oranges' are in the favorite_fruits list, it prints: "You really like oranges!"
 If 'strawberries' are in the favorite_fruits list, it prints: "You really like strawberries!"
