print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I Wonder what you are! \n\t\tUp the world so high, \n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky. \nTwinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are.")

1.The rhyme begins with the line "Twinkle, twinkle, little star," which is a well-known and commonly recited opening line in many cultures.

2.It follows with the line "How I wonder what you are!" This line expresses curiosity and admiration for the star's brilliance, adding to the whimsical and childlike nature of the rhyme.

3.The rhyme then introduces indentation (created using tabs, '\t') to create a visually appealing structure. The indentation adds a sense of depth and rhythm to the poem.

4.The next two lines, "Up the world so high," and "Like a diamond in the sky," continue to describe the star's position and appearance, emphasizing its luminosity and prominence.

5.The rhyme returns to the initial line, "Twinkle, twinkle, little star," and reiterates the curiosity about what the star is.
