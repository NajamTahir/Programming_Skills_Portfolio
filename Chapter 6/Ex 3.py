"""
while True:
    pass  # This loop will run indefinitely
"""
The code uses a while True loop, where the condition is always True. This means the loop will never exit based on a condition.

Inside the loop, the pass statement is used. The pass statement serves as a no-op or a placeholder, indicating that no actions or operations are performed within the loop.

As a result, this loop will continue running endlessly, and it won't have any practical purpose in terms of computation or interaction with the user.
